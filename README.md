# Design-Project-Demo
 We can work on a UI with a button for each of us with a pop up window that appears with a message when you press the button.

- Make a button ( use the available space in the UI to place your button and customize it however you want)
- Make a pop up window with a message or animation when you press it. ( make it intresting )


Making the Button;
- Use the main FXMLDocument.fxml file to make your button and assign the onAction method
- Add your respective onAction method to the FXMLDocumentController.java file 
- Create your own FXML file for the pop up window eg:- Praveen.fxml , and then open the new window with that fxml file when button is pressed.(refer to my code)
